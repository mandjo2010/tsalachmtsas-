#TSALACH-MT-SAS
Tsalachmt is a simple business portfolio. It contains written and photos on some elements needed by the business owner. The goal is to build its activities online to attract more clients.

## Getting Started
The software is available for cloning or download. However the goal is obviously to learn from its development, so the best way to do this is dive into the documentation.

## Goal
The goal of the project for me is to master wagtail through the combination of others django elements:
- Wagtail Streams
- Django allauth
- Wagtail cta 
- Django ecommerce
- etc.

## Prerequisites
A development computer with Python and PostgreSQL. For deployment a Linux server.

## Examples
Development starts from scratch and covers at least the following:
- installing Django and Wagtail in a virtual environment
- setting up a custom user model with address, phone number, photo etc.
- setting up authentication, including email verification and social accounts
- versioning on Github and continuous integration with Travis
- multiple languages
- content management with Wagtail
- webpages with images, embedded video, code
- footer with cookie statement and privacy policy
- editable forms with ReCAPTCHA
- allowing users to comment on articles
- creating an editable navigation menu with language switch and account login
- testing with coverage and factory boy
- deployment on a Linux server with Nginx, Gunicorn and Supervisor
- backup and restore
